   This includes the train prototxt file, label_process.m, and the preprocess matlab file. If you employ this model to predict the block level JND, the specific steps are as follows:

    (1) The training images are selected from the MCL-JCI dataset, the download address is http://mcl.usc.edu/mcl-jci-dataset/. The test images are randomly selected from the Kodark, the download address is http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/

    (2) The train_val.prototxt, quick_solver.prototxt, and train_quick_double_alex6.sh profile are employed to train the JND prediction model. The training label is train_90.txt. The testing label is test_10.txt.
	
	(2) For a test image, the image is firstly compressed under 9 QF values, including 15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55. Then, distorted images are divided into 64*64 non-overlapping blocks.

    (3) For a 64*64 block, 9 labels can be predicted by the trained JND prediction model. Then, the final JND levels for the block and the picture level QF value for the test image can be generated by label_process.m
    
    (4) The source test image can be prepocessed by the preprocess.m, and then the image is compressed under the picture level QF value in (3).
